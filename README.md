## Corrupted data cleaner from CSV

This program skips all the rows of a csv files that are more than expected features.

After cleaning problematic rows, it'll create a new csv file.

#### Input:
- original csv file path 
- path where the new csv will be saved
- number of expected features

#### Output:
A new csv file without corrupted rows.


***Note:* This file only works on network-flows folder's CSV files for now.**
